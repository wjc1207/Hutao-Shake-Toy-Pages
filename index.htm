			<p>My name is Junchi Wang, and I'm a third year college student from Xidian University. I'm really keen on the embedded system and often make some creative products with the development board. <p>
			</p>During the school, I studied a number of courses related to embedded development, including C language programming, microcontroller principles and applications, embedded system design, etc. I excelled in these courses, won several faculties scholarships, and participated in several research projects organized by the school.</p>

			<p>Hutao is a character from a popular game named Genshin impart, and by chance I found a very interesting GIF image published by acumo which is cute and kind of inspired me. Hence, I was planning to build a voice control toy based on it.</p> <!--idea-->
			<p>Hutao Shake Toy is just a destkop ornament with three functions. The first is the night light with alternative lightness. You can change the lightness by the joystick or voice. The second is the local weather station, It just gets the temperature and humidity and shows t on the OLED screen. The third function is the Hutao Shake Toy itself, you can control the toy to work by the joystick or voice.</p><!--description-->

			<p><b>3D printing: </b>3D printing is a manufacturing process that creates three-dimensional objects by layering materials based on a digital design. It allows for the creation of complex shapes and structures with high precision and accuracy, and can be used in a variety of industries including aerospace, healthcare, and architecture. The process involves using a 3D printer to add layer upon layer of material until the final object is complete.</p>
			<p><b>Voice control: </b>Voice control is a technology that enables users to interact with devices and systems using spoken commands. It relies on speech recognition software to understand and interpret the user's voice, and can be used to control a wide range of devices such as smartphones, smart home systems, and cars. Voice control is becoming increasingly popular as it offers a hands-free and convenient way to interact with technology.</p>
			<p><b>modular design: </b>Modular design is an approach to designing systems or products by breaking them down into smaller, independent modules that can be combined in different ways to create a variety of configurations. Each module serves a specific function and can be easily replaced or upgraded without affecting the rest of the system. This approach allows for greater flexibility, scalability, and efficiency in design, manufacturing, and maintenance. It is commonly used in industries such as aerospace, automotive, and electronics, as well as in software development and architecture.</p>
